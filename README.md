## Introduction

**Magi.Spells** is a repository that serves as the source for additional spells used by **Magi.CLI**, a command-line tool that brings a touch of magic to your terminal. The spells in this repository are designed to extend the capabilities of **Magi.CLI**, allowing you to perform complex tasks with simple commands.

Each spell declares its own dependencies, ensuring modularity and scalability. This per-spell dependency management allows you to install only the packages required for the spells you use, keeping your environment clean and efficient.

## Installation

To add spells from **Magi.Spells** to your **Magi.CLI** tool, use the `ponder` command, which handles the installation of spells and their dependencies.

Ensure you have **Magi.CLI** installed:

```bash
pip install magi_cli_pypi
```

Install spells using the `ponder` command:

```bash
cast ponder <spell_name>
```

Replace `<spell_name>` with the name of the spell you wish to install. For example:

```bash
cast ponder runecraft
```

The `ponder` command will fetch the spell from the **Magi.Chamber**, install any required dependencies, and make the spell available for use.

## Spell Dependency Management

Each spell specifies its external dependencies using a special `__requires__` variable within the spell script. This variable is a list of packages that are not part of Python's standard library but are required for the spell to function.

For example:

```python
__requires__ = ['click', 'requests', 'openai']
```

When you install a spell using the `ponder` command:

1. The `ponder` command extracts the `__requires__` variable from the spell.
2. It prompts you for consent before installing the dependencies.
3. It installs the necessary packages, ensuring the spell functions correctly.

### Handling Missing Dependencies

If you attempt to use a spell whose dependencies are not installed, **Magi.CLI** will:

- Gracefully handle the missing dependencies.
- Provide a clear error message indicating which dependencies are missing.
- Suggest running `cast ponder <spell_name>` to install the missing dependencies.

### Lazy Loading of Spells

To prevent issues with missing dependencies at startup, **Magi.CLI** employs lazy loading for spells:

- Spells are only loaded when invoked.
- This approach allows the CLI tool to function even if some spells have unmet dependencies.
- It improves startup performance and reduces unnecessary resource usage.

```bash
cast rc path/to/your/script.sh
```

### Uninstalling a Spell

If you wish to uninstall a spell:
